# Chess Game

This is a chess game made in Android Studio using Java.

I plan to add a chess engine to the game in the future, maybe a way to play online.

Currently, the game is playable with two players locally.
Since, I am still learning how to use Android Studio, the game is not very polished.
Also, the game is not optimized for tablets.
